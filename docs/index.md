## What is this?

A modular fleet management system for manufacturing and logistics — a photorealistic
**Unreal Engine 5 Simulation** standing in for the physical robots, **VDA5050** AGV
communication, **MAPF** multi-agent path finding, and a Crossflow **Task Orchestrator**.
Each piece runs as its own container, so you can swap, test, or deploy any module on its own.

→ See [What is RMF Industrial](/guide/what-is-rmf2) for the full breakdown.

## How these docs work

Read them in order:

1. **[What is RMF Industrial](/guide/what-is-rmf2)** — the big picture and the modules
2. **[Architecture](/guide/architecture)** — how the pieces fit together
3. **[Getting started](/guide/getting-started)** — build the images and bring the stack up
4. **[Demos](/guide/demos)** — run it end to end

From there, each module has its own page — **[Simulation](/guide/simulation)**,
**[VDA5050](/guide/vda5050)**, **[MAPF](/guide/mapf)**,
**[Task Orchestrator](/guide/task-orchestrator)**, **[Scheduler](/guide/scheduler)**, and
**[UI](/guide/ui)** — dive into whichever you need.
