# Create a workflow

A workflow is a **Crossflow diagram**: a small JSON graph the
[Task Orchestrator](/guide/task-orchestrator) executes to coordinate one or more robots.
This page shows how to author one from scratch, then how to send it.

::: tip Read the Crossflow handbook
Everything on this page is covered in more depth, in the
[Crossflow handbook](https://open-rmf.github.io/crossflow-handbook/). It is the best place to
understand how crossflow and its operations (`node`, `fork_clone`, `buffer`, `join`, …) work and how to use
them properly.

## Diagram anatomy

Every diagram has three top-level keys:

| Key | What it is |
| --- | --- |
| `version` | Diagram schema version (currently `"0.1.0"`). |
| `start` | The `id` of the first op to run. |
| `ops` | A map of `id → operation`. The graph is wired by each op's `next`. |

An **operation** has a `type`. The common ones:

| `type` | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `node` | Does the work. Pick a `builder` (e.g. `MAPFGoToNode`, `MQTTTaskRequestNode`) and a `config`. |
| `fork_clone` | Splits flow into parallel branches — `next` is a **list** of op ids. |
| `buffer` | A wait point that holds a branch's result until a `join` collects it. |
| `join` | Waits for all listed `buffers`, then continues. |

`next` points to the id of the op to run next, or `{ "builtin": "terminate" }` to end a
branch.

::: tip Node builders and their config
Each `node` names a `builder` the orchestrator registers — `MAPFGoToNode` (AMR move via AMQP),
`MQTTTaskRequestNode` (transfer tasks: `liftrack` / `depalletize` / `droprack` via MQTT),
`WaitAMRTaskNode`, `DefaultNode`. The `config` keys differ per builder — see
[Workflow nodes](/guide/task-orchestrator#workflow-nodes) for each one's parameters.

## Example: sequential pickup → dropoff

The simplest useful workflow — one robot drives to a rack, picks it up, drives to a drop
location, and puts it down. It chains a `MAPFGoToNode` (move) and a `MQTTTaskRequestNode`
(transfer) per step:

```json
{
  "version": "0.1.0",
  "start": "drive_to_rack",
  "ops": {
    "drive_to_rack": {
      "type": "node",
      "builder": "MAPFGoToNode",
      "display_text": "Manufacturer_2 -> rack P63",
      "config": {
        "asset_name": "Manufacturer_2",
        "coordinates": "P63",
        "task_type": "amr_mapf",
        "task_id": "demo_drive_rack"
      },
      "next": "liftrack"
    },
    "liftrack": {
      "type": "node",
      "builder": "MQTTTaskRequestNode",
      "display_text": "Manufacturer_2 liftrack",
      "config": {
        "id": "urn:ngsild:Task:demo_liftrack",
        "task_type": "liftrack",
        "task_command": "START",
        "asset_id": "Manufacturer_2",
        "task_params": {},
        "max_retries": 3
      },
      "next": "drive_to_dropoff"
    },
    "drive_to_dropoff": {
      "type": "node",
      "builder": "MAPFGoToNode",
      "display_text": "Manufacturer_2 -> dropoff P300",
      "config": {
        "asset_name": "Manufacturer_2",
        "coordinates": "P300",
        "task_type": "amr_mapf",
        "task_id": "demo_drive_dropoff"
      },
      "next": "droprack"
    },
    "droprack": {
      "type": "node",
      "builder": "MQTTTaskRequestNode",
      "display_text": "Manufacturer_2 droprack",
      "config": {
        "id": "urn:ngsild:Task:demo_droprack",
        "task_type": "droprack",
        "task_command": "START",
        "asset_id": "Manufacturer_2",
        "task_params": {},
        "max_retries": 3
      },
      "next": { "builtin": "terminate" }
    }
  }
}
```

Reading it: start at `drive_to_rack` (the AMR moves to rack `P63`), `liftrack` picks the rack
up, `drive_to_dropoff` moves to `P300`, `droprack` sets it down, then terminate. `coordinates`
must be real map waypoints, and every `task_id` / `id` must be unique (see the Task Orchestrator
[limitations](/guide/task-orchestrator#limitations)).

## Example: parallel multi-robot (fork → join)

To move several robots at once, `fork` into a branch per robot and `join` to wait for
all of them. Each branch ends in a `buffer`; the `join` collects every buffer before it
continues. Two robots in the Crossflow editor:

![Fork → join: a Fork Clone splits into two MAPFGoToNode branches (AMR1, AMR2), each ending in a Buffer that a Join collects before Terminate](/demo/crossflow-fork-join.png)

The `fork_clone` splits flow into one branch per robot (`AMR1`, `AMR2` — both `MAPFGoToNode`);
each branch ends in a `buffer`, and the `join` waits for both buffers (inputs `0` and `1`)
before continuing to `terminate`.

::: tip Generate it instead of hand-writing
For N robots, building this by hand is tedious. The
`send_parallel_workflow_3_robots.py` tester generates the fork/buffer/join ops
programmatically — a good template to copy. See
[Try it directly](/guide/task-orchestrator#try-it-directly-send-to-test).

## Run it in the editor

Once a diagram is built (or imported) in the Crossflow frontend editor, click the run button to open
**Run Workflow**, then **RUN** to execute it through the built-in executor.

![Running a workflow in the Crossflow editor — the Request input is left as `{}`](/demo/crossflow-run-workflow.png)

::: tip You don't need any request input
Leave the **Request** field as `{}`. In this implementation the nodes are **self-contained** —
each one reads everything it needs from its own `config` (asset, coordinates, task type, …), so
**upstream inputs are not used** and nothing is piped from one node into the next. An empty
request runs the whole graph.
