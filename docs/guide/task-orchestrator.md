# Task Orchestrator

**Repo:** `rmf2_task_orchestrator` · **Image:** `rmf2_task_orchestrator:latest` · **Container:** `task_orchestrator`

A Rust workflow-execution engine built on [open-rmf crossflow](https://github.com/open-rmf/crossflow). It receives task schedules over
AMQP, executes workflow diagrams, and coordinates robots via AMQP / MQTT.

## What problem it solves

A real warehouse job is rarely a single move: it's "pick at A, then drop at B", "send
three robots in parallel and wait for all of them", with pauses, retries and ordering
constraints. **The orchestrator turns a declarative workflow diagram into coordinated,
monitored, multi-robot execution** — fanning work out across robots, calling MAPF/robot
services in the right order, and reporting status back. It's the layer between
"high-level task" and "individual robot actions".

## Tasks

A few related concepts show up across the system — worth pinning down:

| Term                 | What it is                                                                                                                                         |
| -------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **TaskRequest**      | A single requested action on an asset (e.g. `liftrack`, `depalletize`). See the [Simulation TaskRequest format](/guide/simulation#message-format). |
| **Schedule**         | A wrapper carrying a **workflow diagram** (`{ id, type: "Schedule", payload: <diagram> }`) published to the AMQP `@RECEIVE@` exchange.             |
| **Workflow diagram** | A Crossflow graph of operations (fork / nodes / join). Samples in `workflow_executor/diagrams/`.                                                   |
| **TaskStatus**       | Progress/completion messages emitted as the workflow runs.                                                                                         |

In short: a **Schedule** carries a **workflow diagram** that the orchestrator executes,
which in turn issues **TaskRequests** to robots/services and reports **TaskStatus** back.

## Role in the system

1. A scheduler publishes a **Schedule** (with a workflow diagram) onto the AMQP
   `@RECEIVE@` exchange.
2. The orchestrator executes the diagram, emitting **TaskRequest** messages and tracking
   **TaskStatus**.
3. It coordinates devices and robots with MAPF over MQTT/AMQP, publishing
   status back onto the `@RECEIVE@` amqp exchange

## HTTP API

| Endpoint                  | Method | Description                                                |
| ------------------------- | ------ | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| `/`                       | GET    | Crossflow diagram editor UI                                |
| `/health_check`           | GET    | Health check (used by the launcher's gate)                 |
| `/api/executor/run`       | POST   | Execute a workflow diagram (Crossflow's built-in executor) |
| `/workflow/get_workflows` | GET    | List the `task_id`s of workflows currently executing       |

## AMQP integration

- **Subscribes** to the `@RECEIVE@` RabbitMQ (`localhost:5672`) exchange for `Schedule` and `TaskStatus` messages.
- **Publishes** `TaskRequest` and `TaskStatus` messages to the same exchange.

## Try it directly (send to test)

```bash
cd ~/ros_industrial_ws/rmf_industrial/test_scripts/taskorchestrator

# default: 3 robots to default goals
python3 send_parallel_workflow_3_robots.py

# choose robots and goals
python3 send_parallel_workflow_3_robots.py \
  --robots Manufacturer_2,Manufacturer_3,Manufacturer_4 \
  --goals  P300,P301,P302
```

Watch it run:

```bash
docker logs task_orchestrator --tail 50 -f
```

### Full 25-robot scenario (`send_workflow.py`)

`send_workflow.py` runs the whole fleet. It loads two prebuilt diagrams from the same folder
and publishes each as its own independent `Schedule` to `@RECEIVE@`:

```bash
cd ~/ros_industrial_ws/rmf_industrial/test_scripts/taskorchestrator

# publishes both rack workflows (no args needed)
python3 send_workflow.py

# optional: target a remote broker
python3 send_workflow.py --host <amqp-host> --port 5672
```

The 25 AMRs are split across the two workflows, which the orchestrator executes concurrently:

| Diagram                | Schedule id                | Robots                                | Count |
| ---------------------- | -------------------------- | ------------------------------------- | ----- |
| `rack_workflow_1.json` | `urn:ngsild:Task:rack_wf1` | `Manufacturer_1` – `Manufacturer_12`  | 12    |
| `rack_workflow_2.json` | `urn:ngsild:Task:rack_wf2` | `Manufacturer_13` – `Manufacturer_25` | 13    |

Each diagram is a `fork_clone` into one sequential branch per robot — drive to a rack
(`MAPFGoToNode`), then `liftrack` → move to a manipulator → `depalletize` → `droprack`
(`MQTTTaskRequestNode`) — all rejoined at the end. Both schedules show up together in
`GET /workflow/get_workflows` while they run:

```bash
curl -s http://localhost:2727/workflow/get_workflows | jq
# ["urn:ngsild:Task:rack_wf1","urn:ngsild:Task:rack_wf2"]
```

### Publish a Schedule yourself (AMQP)

Any AMQP client works — publish a `Schedule` to the `@RECEIVE@` fanout exchange. The
`payload` is a Crossflow workflow diagram. Here's a minimal one-node example that sends a
single robot to a waypoint via the `MAPFGoToNode` (the AMQP/MAPF node), then terminates:

```json
{
  "id": "urn:ngsi-ld:Schedule:my-test-01",
  "type": "Schedule",
  "payload": {
    "version": "0.1.0",
    "start": "move_to_goal",
    "ops": {
      "move_to_goal": {
        "type": "node",
        "builder": "MAPFGoToNode",
        "display_text": "Manufacturer_2 -> P300",
        "config": {
          "asset_name": "Manufacturer_2",
          "coordinates": "P300",
          "task_type": "amr_mapf",
          "task_id": "demo_move_1"
        },
        "next": { "builtin": "terminate" }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Notes:

- `builder` must be a node the orchestrator registers — see [Workflow nodes](#workflow-nodes)
  below for the full list and each node's config params.
- `coordinates` must be a real waypoint in the map graph (e.g. `P300`) — an unknown goal makes
  the downstream MAPF solver fail. For multi-robot fan-out, add a `fork_clone` start node, one
  node per robot, and a `join` before `terminate` (see `send_parallel_workflow_3_robots.py`).
- `payload` may be the diagram object (as above) or a JSON-encoded string of it; the orchestrator
  accepts either.

### HTTP execution and query endpoints

The AMQP path above is the one exercised by the demo, and it's the recommended way in. Under
the hood the orchestrator forwards each `Schedule` to Crossflow's built-in executor at
`POST /api/executor/run` (port `2727`) — you can call that endpoint directly with a
`{ "diagram": <diagram>, "request": <context> }` body if you need to bypass AMQP.

The `/workflow` namespace only serves **queries**, not submissions — currently
`GET /workflow/get_workflows`, which lists the `task_id`s of workflows in flight. The
interactive diagram editor is served at the root path `/`.

## Building workflows

There are three ways to author a diagram:

- **By hand** — write the `ops` JSON directly (see the example above). Fine for small graphs.
- **Programmatically** — generate the `fork_clone` / `buffer` / `join` ops in a script, like
  `send_parallel_workflow_3_robots.py`. Best for N-robot fan-out.
- **Visually, in the Crossflow editor** — the orchestrator serves Crossflow's diagram-building
  frontend at the **root path**, e.g. [http://localhost:2727/](http://localhost:2727/). There you
  can lay out nodes, wire the `next` edges, fill in each node's `config`, and run the diagram
  through the built-in executor (`POST /api/executor/run`) — the same execution path AMQP
  `Schedule`s use. To run it later over AMQP, wrap the exported diagram in a `Schedule` and
  publish it to `@RECEIVE@` as shown above.

For a step-by-step workflow building guide, see **[Create a workflow](/guide/create-workflow)**.

## Workflow nodes

These are the `builder` types the orchestrator registers (in `workflow_executor/src/nodes.rs`).
Each diagram op of `"type": "node"` names one of them and passes a `config` object.

**Registration is client-gated:** the three AMQP nodes (`DefaultNode`, `MAPFGoToNode`,
`WaitAMRTaskNode`) register only when an AMQP client is configured; `MQTTTaskRequestNode`
registers only when an MQTT client is configured. Unknown/unavailable builders fail the diagram.

Structural ops are Crossflow built-ins, not custom nodes: `fork_clone` (split into parallel
branches), `join` (wait for buffers), `buffer` (a wait/hand-off point), and the terminal
`{ "builtin": "terminate" }`.

### `MAPFGoToNode` — AMR move via MAPF (AMQP)

Publishes a `TaskRequest` to AMQP and blocks until the matching `TaskStatus` returns. The node's
task id is formatted as `urn:ngsi-ld:Task:{task_id}`, and the emitted request's `taskType` is
always `amr_mapf` (the `task_type` config below is only a label).

| Param                   | Type   | Default           | Description                                                     |
| ----------------------- | ------ | ----------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `asset_name`            | string | `""`              | Robot id, e.g. `Manufacturer_2`                                 |
| `coordinates`           | string | `""`              | Goal waypoint — **must exist in the map graph** (e.g. `P300`)   |
| `task_type`             | string | `""`              | Label only; the published `taskType` is hardcoded to `amr_mapf` |
| `task_id`               | string | `""`              | Unique per node; wrapped as `urn:ngsi-ld:Task:{task_id}`        |
| `publish_exchange`      | string | `@RECEIVE@`       | Exchange the `TaskRequest` is published to                      |
| `publish_routing_key`   | string | `""`              | Routing key (ignored by the fanout exchange)                    |
| `response_exchange`     | string | `@RECEIVE@`       | Exchange the response listener binds to                         |
| `response_queue_prefix` | string | `@RECEIVE@-task-` | Queue-name prefix for the response listener                     |

### `MQTTTaskRequestNode` — devices/handover task (MQTT)/manipulation

Used for `liftrack` / `depalletize` / `droprack` / `dropoff`. Publishes a `TaskRequest` to
`asset/{asset_id}/task_request`, subscribes to `asset/{asset_id}/task_status`, and waits for a
terminal status: `COMPLETED` → node done, `FAILED` → node fails, `REJECTED` → re-publish (up to
`max_retries`). The outgoing request id is `{id}:TaskRequest`.

| Param                 | Type   | Default | Description                                                        |
| --------------------- | ------ | ------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `id`                  | string | `""`    | Base task id, e.g. `urn:ngsild:Task:task_Depalletize001`           |
| `task_type`           | string | `""`    | `liftrack` / `depalletize` / `droprack`                            |
| `task_command`        | string | `START` | `taskCommand` field on the request                                 |
| `asset_id`            | string | `""`    | Target asset — sets the MQTT topic `asset/{asset_id}/task_request` |
| `task_params`         | object | `{}`    | Arbitrary params forwarded in the request                          |
| `task_expected_start` | string | `""`    | Passed through to the request                                      |
| `task_expected_end`   | string | `""`    | Passed through to the request                                      |
| `max_retries`         | int    | `3`     | Re-publish attempts on `REJECTED`                                  |

### `WaitAMRTaskNode` — timed wait (AMQP)

Sleeps for `wait_duration_secs`, then publishes a `TaskStatus: COMPLETED` (id
`{task_id}:TaskStatus`) to `@RECEIVE@`. Handy for awaiting/simulating an AMR step without a robot.

| Param                | Type   | Default | Description                               |
| -------------------- | ------ | ------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| `asset_name`         | string | `""`    | Robot id (logging)                        |
| `task_id`            | string | `""`    | Used to build the emitted `TaskStatus` id |
| `task_type`          | string | `""`    | `taskType` on the emitted status          |
| `wait_duration_secs` | int    | `14`    | Seconds to wait before completing         |

### `DefaultNode` — pass-through (AMQP)

Logs and forwards the workflow context unchanged. Useful as a placeholder.

| Param     | Type   | Default | Description             |
| --------- | ------ | ------- | ----------------------- |
| `task_id` | string | `""`    | Identifier used in logs |

## Limitations

Known constraints in this version:

- **AMQP exchange is fanout-only.** The exchange kind is hardcoded to `fanout` (both the
  consumer and publisher in `amqp/src/amqp.rs`) — it is not configurable, so `direct` / `topic`
  / `headers` routing is not supported. `routing_key` is therefore ignored; every bound consumer
  receives every message.
- **Task IDs must be unique.** The orchestrator correlates AMQP `TaskStatus` responses back to
  in-flight requests by `task_id` (and tracks active workflows by `Schedule` id). Two tasks
  sharing an id collide. A response can be delivered to the wrong waiter and duplicate
  `Schedule` ids clash in `get_workflows`. Give every node and schedule a distinct id.
  - **Workaround:** omit `task_id` from a node's `config` entirely rather than reusing one.
