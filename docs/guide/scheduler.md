## Design

![Robot Task Scheduler architecture](/demo/rts-architecture.png)

| Components | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Robot Task Generator (RTG) | Generate the robot and machine tasks from work orders / jobs |
| RTS Endpoints | Static CRUD endpoints (REST API) for schedule updates. This allows schedule changes 7 days from now. |
| Task Preprocessing | Add in a rough estimate for the task duration based on previous experience (from stochastic model). Adjust the start time based on task duration and task dependencies. |
| Data Validation | Validate the tasks input after the preprocessing before updating the database. This component checks for invalid dependencies, invalid schema, id etc. |
| Optimization Pre-processing | This component takes in all the tasks 24 hrs from now, update their start time based on dependencies and check for any needs for optimization. If optimization is required, this component will create the optimization problem (variables, constraints and objective function) based on the 24 hrs tasks' information. This component can also request for additional information needed for the problem formulation, such as robot states, stochastic model route timing, etc. |
| Optimization Solver | This is the scheduler optimization solver. It will solve for an optimal solution. If no feasible solution can be found, the solver can provide a best-case alternative. |
| Optimization Post-processing | Validate the solution from the solver and convert them to schedule updates. |
| Schedule Changes Update | Update the schedule in the database with new assignment and new start time. |
| Execution Pre-processing | This component takes in all the tasks 10 min from now and convert them to the format for the task orchestrator to execute. |
| Send for execution | Send the tasks to the Task Orchestrator for execution. |
| Task Execution Monitor | Upon delay, completion, cancellation or failure during task execution, this component updates the schedule database. Based on these information, the optimization pipeline may be triggered to adjust the schedule. The Stochastic Model also uses this module for operational data collection. |

## Task Data Structure

| Field | Type | Required | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `id` | string | required | Task ID, in IOCS this is stored as `urn:<id>` |
| `type` | string | required | Task type, this is used to distinguish execution methods. This can also be used for conflict checking and optimization. |
| `description` | string | optional | Additional description of the task. |
| `start_time` | ISOTime | required | Start time of the task. This is updated to the actual start time once the task execution has started. |
| `end_time` | ISOTime | optional | End time of the task. This is updated to the actual end time once the task execution has completed. |
| `process_id` | string | optional | The process this task belongs to. |
| `series_id` | string | optional | The reoccurring series the task belongs to. This is unused in IHI use cases. |
| `status` | string | optional | The status of the task. |
| `resource_id` | string | optional | The Resource ID assigned to this task. |
| `deadline` | ISOTime | optional | The deadline of the task. |
| `planned_start_time` | ISOTime | optional | Planned start time of the task. |
| `planned_end_time` | ISOTime | optional | Planned end time of the task. |
| `estimated_duration` | float | optional | The estimated duration of the task. |
| `actual_start_time` | ISOTime | optional | Actual start time of the task. |
| `actual_end_time` | ISOTime | optional | Actual end time of the task. |
| `task_details` | JSON | optional | Additional use case specific data. |

## Process Data Structure

| Field | Type | Required | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `id` | string | required | Task ID, in IOCS this is stored as `urn:<id>` |
| `graph` | JSON | required | Task relationship, only Task IDs are stored here. |

A Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) of task relationships is recorded as JSON, with only
the Task IDs stored in the `graph` field.

## Onboard a new task type

The RMF2 Scheduler allows the user to define how a **task is converted into an element
in the BehaviorTree**.

Below is an example of how this can be done using the Scheduler Python API.

First define a custom `TaskExecutor`.

```python
from rmf2_scheduler import TaskExecutor, ExecutorData
from rmf2_scheduler.data import Task

class MyAwesomeTaskExecutor(TaskExecutor):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__()

    def build(self, task: Task):
        executor_data = ExecutorData();
        coorindates = task.task_details["coordinates"]
        asset_name = task.resource_id
        out = (
            "SubTree " +
            f"ID=\"ReplaceMAPF\" task_id=\"{task.id}\" " +
            "bt_id=\"{bt_id}\" task_status=\"{task_status}\" connection=\"{connection}\" " +
            f"coordinates=\"{coorindates}\" " +
            f"asset_name=\"{asset_name}\""
        )
        executor_data.set_data_as_string(out)
        return True, None, executor_data

    def start(self, id: str, executor_data: ExecutorData):  # Currently not used
        return True, "Undefined"
```

Then in `app.py` (under `src/rmf2_scheduler/demos/rmf2_scheduler_server`), add in the
following line.

```python
task_executors = {
    "ihi/go_to_amr": GoToAMRTaskExecutor(),
    "ihi/wait_amr": WaitAMRTaskExecutor(),
    "ihi/warehouse_task": WareHouseTaskExecutor(),
    "rmf2/mapf": MAPFTaskExecutor(),
    "ihi/dummy": DummyTaskExecutor(),
    "my_new_task_type": MyAwesomeTaskExecutor(),
}
```

## REST API Endpoints

Please make sure **Installation - IOCS Robot Task Generator & Scheduler** is completed,
and the RMF2 Scheduler Server is running at <http://localhost:8079>.

The endpoints swagger can be accessed at <http://localhost:8079/docs>.

## Basic Tutorials

### Create a task using REST Endpoints

::: tip
Please make sure a RMF2 Scheduler Server is running. For more, check out the
**Quick Start** in the [`rmf2_scheduler` docs](https://rmf-scheduler.readthedocs.io/).
:::

Let's create a **Task** in the scheduler using the `POST /schedule/edit` API
and the `TASK_ADD` **ScheduleAction**.

This tutorial requires some utility command line tools. Run the following command
to install them.

```bash
sudo apt install coreutils curl uuid-runtime jq
```

**Step 1 - Dry run**

Let's do a **dry-run** of the REST API query. This checks if the query is valid.
No changes are made to the schedule stored.

Run the following cURL command.

```bash
curl --location 'localhost:8000/schedule/edit' \
     --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
     --data-raw '{
       "type": "TASK_ADD",
       "task": {
         "id": "'$(uuidgen)'",
         "start_time": "'$(date -u -Iseconds)'",
         "type": "rmf2/dummy"
       }
     }'
```

You should receive a successful response as follows.

```
{"message":"Dry run successfully."}
```

**Step 2 - add task**

Let's run the command with **dry-run disabled**. This command changes the schedule
stored. Simply append query parameter `dry_run=false` to the URL.

`localhost:8000/schedule/edit?dry_run=false`

The full cURL command is as follows.

```bash
curl --location 'localhost:8000/schedule/edit?dry_run=false' \
     --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
     --data-raw '{
       "type": "TASK_ADD",
       "task": {
         "id": "'$(uuidgen)'",
         "start_time": "'$(date -u -Iseconds)'",
         "type": "rmf2/dummy"
       }
     }'
```

Upon success, you should receive the following response.

```
{"message":"Schedule updated successfully!"}
```

**Step 3 - Verification**

Let's verify the task we have created.

To retrieve the task we have created, you can use the `GET /schedule/` API.

Simply run the following cURL command.

```bash
curl -sS localhost:8000/schedule/ | jq .
```

You should receive a response similar to the following.

```json
{
  "tasks": [
    {
      "type": "rmf2/dummy",
      "start_time": "2025-04-21T10:28:10Z",
      "id": "d37b295a-6fbc-431c-a87d-ece7607c9f89",
      "status": ""
    }
  ],
  "processes": []
}
```

::: tip
RMF2 scheduler interprets and stores time in UTC timezone by default. The time
output follows the [ISO 8601 format](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601).
