# Launch scripts

The `ros_industrial_demo/launch` directory orchestrates the whole stack. The **tmux**
launcher runs each step in its own pane, so every service is visible as it comes up.

## `start_environment_tmux.sh`

Runs one ordered **step table** inside a tmux session (`ihi_demo`). Each step's command
is sent to its own pane and gated on a health probe before the next step runs.

```bash
./start_environment_tmux.sh            # run all steps with health gates
./start_environment_tmux.sh --step N   # re-run from step N onward (debugging)
./start_environment_tmux.sh --status   # ports / containers / tmux status
./start_environment_tmux.sh --help
```

### Step table

| #   | Step                        | tmux pane      | Health gate                          |
| --- | --------------------------- | -------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| 1   | Dashboard (`rmf2-launcher`) | `Dashboard.0`  | port `8083`                          |
| 2   | Broker (IOCS)               | `IOCS.0`       | `http://localhost:8000/status`       |
| 3   | MQTT                        | `IOCS.1`       | sleep 3s                             |
| 4   | MAPF (unified)              | `Services.0`   | port `8888`                          |
| 5   | Task Orchestrator           | `Services.1`   | `http://localhost:2727/health_check` |
| 6   | Devices (VDA5050)           | `Devices.0`    | log match `vda5050_fiware: state`    |
| 7   | Simulation                  | `Sim.0`        | sleep 10s                            |
| 8   | Init System                 | `InitSystem.0` | sleep 5s                             |
| 9   | Send Task                   | `SendTask.0`   | sleep 3s                             |

The step table is the single source of truth. To add or edit a step, see the
`launch/how_to_add_step.md` guide in the repo.

::: tip Debugging a failed step
On a failed gate the launcher prints the failing pane's last 20 lines and leaves the
session running. Attach and inspect:

```bash
tmux attach -t ihi_demo      # then switch to the failing window
```

:::

## `stop_environment_tmux.sh`

Tears everything down in **reverse** order, then kills the `ihi_demo` session. It is
best-effort — a single failure never aborts the rest — and is safe to run from inside the
session (it kills that session last).

```bash
./stop_environment_tmux.sh            # graceful stop + kill the tmux session
./stop_environment_tmux.sh --hard     # also force-remove leftover containers/ports
./stop_environment_tmux.sh --status
./stop_environment_tmux.sh --help
```

Steps 8 (Init) and 9 (Send Task) are one-shot, so teardown covers steps 7 → 1.

## Control scripts

The launcher calls per-service control scripts (each takes `start` / `stop`):

| Script                         | Service                |
| ------------------------------ | ---------------------- |
| `rmf2_unified_mapf_control.sh` | MAPF unified container |
| `task_orchestrator_control.sh` | Task Orchestrator      |
| `rmf2_res_vda5050_control.sh`  | VDA5050 bridge         |
| `simulation/Linux/RMF2_SIM.sh` | UE5 simulation binary  |
| `rmf2_res_mqtt_control.sh`     | Mosquitto MQTT         |
| `rmf2_res_broker_control.sh`   | IOCS broker stack      |
